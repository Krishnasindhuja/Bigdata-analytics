a.	plot(gold_target1$`0.1`,gold_target1$`0.4`)

b.	linear_fitting = lm(gold_target1$`0.1`~ gold_target1$`0.4`)

c.	par(mfrow=c(2,2))> plot(linear_fitting)

d.	The Residuals are spaced around the estimated regression line. We can assume from this inference that relationship is reasonably linear. The points are distributed in a uniform band from (-4, 4) that means the error variations is uniform.

(There seemed to be 3 points out of pattern with the rest of them. Since it is a smaller data set, the difference shown is very high but it doesn’t actually contribute to the deviation from linear assumption a lot.) 

e.	>ypred = predict(linear_fitting)
> par(mfrow=c(1,1))
      > plot(gold_target1$`0.4`,ypred,type='l', xlab="observed y", ylab="predicted y")
      > points(gold_target1$`0.4`, ypred)

a. > plot(gold_target1$`0.4`,gold_target1$`0_1`)

b. > plot(gold_target1$`0.1`,gold_target1$`0_1`)

c. > glm.out = glm(gold_target1$`0_1` ~ gold_target1$`0.1`, family=binomial(logit), data=gold_target1)

d. > plot(gold_target1$`0_1`~gold_target1$`0.1`)
   > lines(gold_target1$`0.1`,glm.out$fitted,type="l", col="red")

e. > glm.out_combined = glm(gold_target1$`0_1` ~ gold_target1$`0.1`+gold_target1$`0.4`, family=binomial(logit), data=gold_target1)

f. Estimated coefficient for gold_target$’0.1’ for glm.out(summary) = 1.7427
Estimated coefficient for gold_target$’0.1’ for glm.out_combined(summary) = 0.9190
The confidence for the two estimates remains the same.
